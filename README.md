# vim-commenter: a demo Vim plugin to toggle comment line(s) for code files

This plugin is an exercise demo with the latest vim9script syntax. It currently supports Python(`*.py`) and C(`*.c`) code files.

Also, this demo plugin supports multi-line operations.

For toggling the comment for the current line, just press `gc`; for multiple lines toggling, use `[count]gc`.
